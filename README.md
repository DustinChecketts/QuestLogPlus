# QuestLogPlus
A World of Warcraft: Classic addon that displays Quest Level and Experience in the Quest Log.

Quest Log Plus combines the functionality of two different quest log addons for Classic servers. Ideal for players who want to retain the look of a native user interface with a few modern advancements. The quest level aids players in understanding the intended difficulty of a particular quest. Displaying the experience allows players to easily identify and prioritize quests based upon how much experience they reward upon completion.
